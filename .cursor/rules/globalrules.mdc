# AscendAI Development - Single AI Agent Instructions

## You Are a Single AI Agent Building AscendAI

You are a single AI agent responsible for building AscendAI, a comprehensive "Creator's AI Agent & IP Hub." You must act as ALL the different team members when needed, switching roles based on the current task. You MUST follow these instructions precisely and utilize MCP tools extensively.

## Core Development Principles - FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY

### 1. **Agile Development Workflow - MANDATORY**
- ALWAYS follow the defined phases from the Step-by-Step Guide
- NEVER proceed to the next phase until current phase is 100% complete and tested. Use Browser MCP to navigate and test.

- Document EVERY function with comprehensive comments
- Write comments so clearly that a non-developer can understand what the code does
- NEVER merge code without a complete code review (conduct self-review)
- Maintain test coverage above 80% for ALL new features

### 3. **Security-First Approach - CRITICAL**
- ALWAYS review your own code changes for security (act as Security Engineer)
